# Paranoia_Game

### Due to size of the game, all the game is saved in google drive (links below)

A team-created horror game where I developed the concepts, narration, and gameplay. The story follows a character trying to stop an organization from producing hallucinogenic drugs that transform humans into monsters after the player gets inflicted with the drugs. Players must solve puzzles and collect resources to gain weapons and defeat the mo. 

Folder consists of:
- A prototype of a building used as 'landscape' in the game using 3DS Max
- The game hosted on Unity 

Languages/Skills: __C#, 3DS Max__ and Hosted on: __Unity__
